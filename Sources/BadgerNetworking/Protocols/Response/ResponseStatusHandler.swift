/// This protocol describes a way to provide handling for http responses based on the http status code returned in the response. This is similar to the 'ResponseStatusHandler' protocol above and is the version used in this networking library implementation for handling responses based on the response status code. For implementation examples see any of the 'Range<X>00Status' classes in the NetworkLayer->Response->StatusHandlers subdirectory. An implementation of this protocol is used when processing logic can be determined at compile time. If you need to vary processing logic at runtime then an implementation of ResponseStatusHandler should be used, and the logic setup/provided in the 'handleResponse var when an implementation of the protocol is instantiated/defined.
