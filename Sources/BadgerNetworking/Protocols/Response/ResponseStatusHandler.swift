/// This protocol describes a way to provide handling for http responses based on the http status code returned in the response. This is similar to the 'HTTPStatusHandler' protocol below, except that the 'handleResponse' functionality is a property instead of a function. This protocol is currently implemented in the 'StatusHandler' class found in the 'StatusHandlers' subdirectory of the NetworkLayer->Response directory. This implementation is not currently used, but is provided as an alternate way to provide handling for http status codes if desired. If you wish to define handling logic at runtime and switch between processing logic for a given http status code then an implementation of this protocol should be sufficient for that use case. If processing logic can be provided in advance then an implementation of the HTTPStatusHandler class is what you should use.

/// This protocol describes a way to provide handling for http responses based on the http status code returned in the response. This is similar to the 'ResponseStatusHandler' protocol above and is the version used in this networking library implementation for handling responses based on the response status code. For implementation examples see any of the 'Range<X>00Status' classes in the NetworkLayer->Response->StatusHandlers subdirectory. An implementation of this protocol is used when processing logic can be determined at compile time. If you need to vary processing logic at runtime then an implementation of ResponseStatusHandler should be used, and the logic setup/provided in the 'handleResponse var when an implementation of the protocol is instantiated/defined.
